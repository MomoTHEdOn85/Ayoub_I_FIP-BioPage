Assignment Description
This is a small team assignment based on your FIP roles. Choose one team member
to “own” the project with a Github repo.
Create a Team Bio App based on your partners for the Integrated Project. You’ll have some
standard team copy on the page initially (written by you); use routes with Express to display a
page for each team member.
Please note - this will NOT be a shared grade. Each team member will receive a grade based
on their individual contributions to the project.
In other words - failure to contribute a bio page using git (branch, commits, pull request and
merge) will result in a 0 for that team member.

Assignment Requirements
Design a team bio page. Creatively how this looks and feels is entirely up to you. Please note
that this can be used as an intro for your presentations if you choose; however the focus of the
assignment is using routes with Node and Express. Minimal (but still well-done) design is
acceptable.
Use routes with Node and Express to display one page for each team member. The content can
be static - no database, Vue or front-end JavaScript required. You’ll need to agree on a layout
and navigation controls.
Create a theme or template each team member can use to populate with their content. Each
team member is responsible for populating this template as their own page IE john.html,
joe.html, nick.html. You’ll be using routing to display the individual bio content on a click /
loading that person’s page.
